# Change history

## Nov 2 2014

  Minor, but very impoortant fix.

  * **Fixes**:

    * Node selection in partition map was flawed on first refresh.

  * **Incompatible changes**:

    * `Expiration` and `Generation` in `WritePolicy` are now `int32`
    * `TaskId` in `Statement` is now always set in the client, and is `int64`

  * **New Features**:

    * float32, float64 and bool are now supported in map and array types

## Oct 15 2014 (Beta 2)

  * **Hot fix**:

    * Fixed pack/unpack for uint64

## Aug 20 2014 (Beta 1)

  Major changes and improvements.

  * **New Features**:

    * Added client.Query()
    * Added client.ScanNode()/All()
    * Added client.Operate()
    * Added client.CreateIndex()
    * Added client.DropIndex()
    * Added client.RegisterUDF()
    * Added client.RegisterUDFFromFile()
    * Added client.Execute()
    * Added client.ExecuteUDF()
    * Added client.BatchGet()
    * Added client.BatchGetHeader()
    * Added client.BatchExists()
    * Added LDT implementation
    * Added `Node` and `Key` references to the Record

  * **Changes**:

    * Many minor and major bug fixes
    * Potentially breaking change: Reduced Undocumented API surface
    * Fixed a few places where error results were not checked
    * Breaking Change: Convert Key.namespace & Key.setName from pointer to string; affects Key API
    * Renamed all `this` receivers to appropriate names
    * Major performance improvements (~2X improvements in speed and memory consumption):
      * better memory management for commands; won't allocate if capacity is big enough
      * better hash management in key; avoids two redundant memory allocs
      * use a buffer pool to reduce GC load
      * fine-grained, customizable and deterministic buffer pool implementation for command

    * Optimizations for Key & Digest
      * changed digest implementation, removed an allocation
      * Added RIPEMD160 hash files from crypto to lib
      * pool hash objects

    * Various Benchmark tool improvements
      * now profileable using localhost:6060
      * minor bug fixes
