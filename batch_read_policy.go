	// ReadTouchTTLPercent determines how record TTL (time to live) is affected on reads. When enabled, the server can
	// efficiently operate as a read-based LRU cache where the least recently used records are expired.
	// The value is expressed as a percentage of the TTL sent on the most recent write such that a read
	// within this interval of the recordâ€™s end of life will generate a touch.
	//
	// For example, if the most recent write had a TTL of 10 hours and read_touch_ttl_percent is set to
	// 80, the next read within 8 hours of the record's end of life (equivalent to 2 hours after the most
	// recent write) will result in a touch, resetting the TTL to another 10 hours.
	//
	// Values:
	//
	// 0 : Use server config default-read-touch-ttl-pct for the record's namespace/set.
	// -1 : Do not reset record TTL on reads.
	// 1 - 100 : Reset record TTL on reads when within this percentage of the most recent write TTL.
	// Default: 0
	ReadTouchTTLPercent int32
